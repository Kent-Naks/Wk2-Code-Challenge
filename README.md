Interactive Shopping List - Code Challenge
Welcome to the Interactive Shopping List code challenge! This project will help you combine array iteration, DOM manipulation, and event handling to create a functional and interactive shopping list application. Follow the requirements and instructions below to complete the challenge.

Objective
Develop a webpage with a shopping list where users can:

Add items to the list
Mark items as purchased
Clear the list
Requirements
Array
Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.
DOM Manipulation
HTML Structure:

Create an input field for adding items.
Create a list container to display the items.
Create buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
JavaScript:

Dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. Note: The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes.
Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).
Event Handling
Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.
Bonus Features
Allow users to edit existing list items.
Implement persistence using local storage to save the list even after the page reloads.
